# Simon_Game
* Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope.<br />
* The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.<br />
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

## You can play the Game by yourself here:

* The game plays soundsüé∂ on button click, Changes color of the backgroud to `red` when you press the wrong sequence.
* The techologies used to build the project are `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`.<br />
* All the functionalities like `button click`, `button animation`, `sound play`, `light flicker`, `background change`, `level change`, etc. have been purely codes using JavaScript.
